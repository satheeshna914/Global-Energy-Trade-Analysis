# Global-Energy-Trade-Analysis
Energy is essential to a wide range of economic and social activities in modern societies, sometimes referred to as the â€œblood of the modern economy". In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on transitioning towards sustainable energy sources to mitigate environmental concerns and ensure long-term energy security. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of global energy consumption trends from 2000 to 2020 using the "Global Data on Sustainable Energy" dataset. The primary objective is to forecast future primary energy consumption per capita, accounting for both local and global impacts.
The study incorporates ARIMA for country-wise time series forecasting to predict future primary energy consumption per capita. Additionally, LSTM is used to capture global impacts by considering data from all countries. The results offer valuable insights into past trends and future energy consumption predictions, aiding in the development of policies for sustainable energy usage. 

# Objectives
- To analyze the trends in global energy consumption from 2000-2020.
- To forecast future primary energy consumption per capita using ARIMA and LSTM models.
- To explore the correlation between energy consumption and factors like access to electricity, renewable energy usage, GDP per capita, and carbon emissions.
- To gain insights into local and global energy consumption patterns to assist in policy development for sustainable energy.

# Solution
- ARIMA Model: Applied for country-specific time-series forecasting of primary energy consumption per capita, capturing local trends.
- LSTM Model: Used to forecast global energy consumption, considering data from all countries together to account for global patterns.
- Advanced Data Scaling: Different scaling methods were used for LSTM to improve model performance and accuracy.
